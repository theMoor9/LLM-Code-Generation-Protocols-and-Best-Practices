This repository contains two documents that define structured protocols for interacting with an artificial intelligence assistant (Large Language Model) to generate code quickly and efficiently:

1. [Smart Code Support Protocol ‚ö°](./EN/smart_code_protocol.md)  Reading time: 3 min
2. [Advanced Code Support Protocol üéõÔ∏è](./EN/advanced_code_protocol.md) Reading time: 5 min

[IT](./IT/)

## Objective

The objective of these protocols is to provide a structured guide for users to:

- Formulate clear and focused code requests
- Adhere to best practices to obtain optimal results
- Use standardized templates and formats for requests
- Ensure efficient collaboration between users and the LLM assistant

## Contents

Each protocol includes:

1. **Standard Rules**
    - Guidelines for users and the assistant to strictly follow
2. **Best Practices**
    - Indications on when and how to use the templates
    - Suggestions for formulating effective requests
    - Use cases to avoid
3. **Base Template**
    - Standardized format for submitting code requests
4. **Usage Examples**
    - Specific use cases with filled-in templates

## Usage

To make the best use of these protocols, we suggest you:

1. Familiarize yourself with the standard rules and best practices
2. Use the base templates to formulate your requests
3. Follow the provided examples to better understand the workflow
4. Actively collaborate with the LLM assistant while respecting the guidelines

Happy with the rapid and efficient generation of code!
